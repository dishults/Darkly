At the Survey page we can choose a grade we give each subject.
By inspecting the fields with values we can see that they are hard coded
and we can easily change them and assign waaay more points than supposed to,
thus, altering the results of the survey dramatically.

FIX
- at the least, check server-side the values recieved, that they are >= 1 and <= 10
- better yet, on the client side use custom values like "salt", "pepper", "spice", etc
    and then convert them at the server to number values 1, 2, 3, etc.
