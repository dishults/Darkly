At the bottom of the page when you click on Â©BornToSec you are taken to a page
with a wierd address e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c
    which, by the way, translates to TAMERE from sha256 (check with https://www.dcode.fr/hash-function)
From there if you check the source code you can see that something's going on
with all the spaces and comments, but two particular ones stand out:

- You must cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step
- Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

From this information you can conclude that the first one is about "referer" header
and the second is about "User-Agent" header that tells the server which browser is being used.

So, by setting those two headers and sending a GET request, you can then find a flag in the response.

FIX

- There is nothing much you can do about verifying those headers. That being said, you can try:
- Don't relying on those or other headers that could be spoofed for any kind of
    verification that would lead to showing sensitive information or access to private resources.
    Just use them for something innocent like analytics and logging.
    And check users priviliges through other means, such as authentication.
- You can even set "Referrer-Policy" header to "no-referrer" to mitigate this issue altogether.
