As metioned in OWASP you can get a list of known and most common passwords at 
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/
Navigate to Common-Credentials and download 10k-most-common.txt

For this solution to work you don't need a username (use 'me', or 'admin' or leave it blanc), 
but the most common usernames for admins you can find at:
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/CommonAdminBase64.txt

First, determine what you should send with your GET request.
Enter any username and password and click submit.
Since it's a GET request, you can check the URL for what parameters were sent.
    For POST requests:
    In browser open Network - All - Headers,
    scroll to the bottom and check Query String Parameters

Then, pre-fill parameters 'page', 'username', 'Login'.
Set 'password' to one of the 10k-most-common and send that request.
Try that for every password.

FIX
- limit failed login (ex. block after 5 attemps)
- use multi-factor authentication
- password checking:
    - check that you don't have the most common passwords on your systeme
        else -> send a prompt to user to change it
    - don't allow new users to use them when creating an account
    - raise password complexity requirement
        (ex. should be >= 8 chars with 1 upper, 1 num, 1 special)
- change requests to be passed not thorught GET(in the URL)
    but through POST(in the message body) to be more secure
