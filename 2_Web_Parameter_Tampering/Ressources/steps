Click sign in => I forgot my password. Then immeadiately you see that there is
no field to enter your email or username, only the 'submit' button.
By inspecting that button you can see that right above it
there is an input block with type 'hidden' and email already pre-filled.
Change 'webmaster' to anything (ex. 'me') and click submit.

FIX

- Just because it's a "hidden" field, doesn't mean it can't be found.
    Itâ€™s only hidden when running the page and visible with source code inspector.
    So, instead, just store such data in a backend database and don't ever put
    in html the email for where such requests should be sent, always store such info server-side
    and send only a session ID to the browser.
- To check that the form and your "hidden" fields hasn't been tampered
    you can use "Message Digest" algorithms (md5, sha1, etc),
    which are similar to to checksums that produce a "fingerprint" of the characters
    that changes if the characters has been changed (tampered). Then, when the form
    is submited, the hidden fields returned can be fingerprinted again
    and compared to the original fingerprint.
