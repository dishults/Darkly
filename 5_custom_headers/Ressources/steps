At the bottom of the page when we click on Â©BornToSec we are taken to a page
with a wierd address e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c
    which, by the way, translates to TAMERE from sha256 (check with https://www.dcode.fr/hash-function)
From there if we check the source code we can see that something's going on
with all the spaces and comments, but two particular ones stand out:

- You must cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step
- Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

From this information we can infer that the first one is about "referer" header
and the second is about "User-Agent" header that tells the server which browser is being used.

So we set those two headers and send our GET request, then look for a flag in the response.

FIX
- don't rely on those headers for any kind of verification that would lead to 
    showing sensitive information. Better to check users' clearence level server-side.
