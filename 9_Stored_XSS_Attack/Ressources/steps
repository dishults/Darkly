At the Feedback page enter 'script' into either 'name' or 'message', that way, if
text field is incorrectly implemented, you put a permanent code on the server that will be
sent to and run on every user's machine when he/she visits the page.

FIX

- HTML Encode Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Element Content:

<body>
...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...
</body>

<div>
...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...
</div>

To do that change (&, <, >, ", ') characters in user input, so that you can print them,
but they won't be considered as part of the code and won't allow executing of any kind,
they'll be just text, plain and simple text:
    & --> &amp;
    < --> &lt;
    > --> &gt;
    " --> &quot;
    ' --> &#x27;
Most web frameworks have a method for HTML encoding/escaping for these characters.
