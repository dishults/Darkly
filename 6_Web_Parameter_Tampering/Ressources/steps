At the Survey page we can choose a grade we give each subject.
By inspecting the fields with values we can see that they are hard coded
and we can easily change them and assign waaay more points than supposed to,
thus, altering the results of the survey dramatically.

FIX

- At least, use validators to check server-side the values recieved, that they are >= 1 and <= 10
- Better yet, on the client side use custom values like "salt", "pepper", "spice", etc.
    and at your surver have a dictionary with corresponding number values 1, 2, 3, etc.
    and so if a recieved value is not in a dictionary, server would through an error.
