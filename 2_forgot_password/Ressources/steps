Click sign in => I forgot my password
Then immeadiately you see that there is no field to enter your email or username, only the 'submit' button
By inspecting that button you can see that right above it there is an input block with type 'hidden' and email already pre-filled.
Change 'webmaster' to anything (ex. 'me') and click submit.

FIX
- don't put in html email for where such requests should be sent, instead, handle that server-side
