At the file upload page we try to upload a file of a different type by
pretending it's an image.

By inspecting the form for file upload we find relevant info to make our request:
    <input name="uploaded" type="file" />
	<input type="submit" name="Upload" value="Upload">
So, we creat our script accordingly, upload the file and look for the flag
in the response.
