At the file upload page we try to upload a file of a different type by
pretending it's an image.

By inspecting the form for file upload we find relevant info to make our request:
    <input name="uploaded" type="file" />
	<input type="submit" name="Upload" value="Upload">
So, we creat our script accordingly, upload the file and look for the flag
in the response.

FIX

- Never trust user input and never run code from it or make it's files executable.
- Check the file extention and only accept the necessary ones.
- At the server, in a sandbox, check all the files that are uploaded to it 
    through scanning and validation
    before making them available for users or saving them.
    If in doubt, discard the file and show the error message.
- All the control and Unicode characters should be removed from the filenames and their extensions,
    without any exception. Also, the special characters such as “;”, “:”, “>”, “<”, “/” ,”\”,
    additional “.”, “*”, “%”, “$”, and so on should be discarded as well.
    If you don't need to have Unicode characters,
    it is highly recommended to only accept Alpha-Numeric characters
    and only 1 dot as an input for the file name and the extension;
    in which the file name and also the extension should not be empty.
- Limit the filename length and file size.
- Check the set limits server-side.
- If possible, consider saving the files in a database rather than on the filesystem.
- If possible, file uploaders should be only accessible to authenticated and authorised users.
