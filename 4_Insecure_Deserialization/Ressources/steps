In a browser inspector click Application -> Cookies
and you can see just one labeled "I_am_admin" with a value looking a lot like a hash.
By decrypting it with md5 we get 'false'.
So, just get what is the value 'true' in md5 and replace it, reload the page.

FIX
- sign the Cookie and verify it's the same with the request
- don't use Cookies to determin if user is admin or not, verify that server-side
- don't use md5 for encryption, 
    or use it with salt (password = 'password' + 'some_word')
